# Online Judge Solutions
This repository is used to store the solutions 
I submitted to the online judges.  
Soon my website will use this repository to store the source code, 
not showing it directly, which is time-consuming and tiring.
## How to browse the files
First, open the folder with the name of the online judge. 
Then you should see the files named by the problem id.  
File histories are available!
